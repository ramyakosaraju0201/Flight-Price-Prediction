Brief Description:
             A flight price prediction programme that estimates ticket prices based on factors including Arrival date, Destination date source,
destination, stops, and airline. The data used in this project is available to the public on Kaggle. The dataset undergoes Data Cleaning, 
Exploratory Data Analysis, which provides insights into the data, and then employs Machine Learning techniques to train the data for prediction.
             RandomForestRegressor ML algorithm is used to solve the regression problem and produce reliable price prediction results. With the 
aid of a web application made with Flask, users may interact and receive precise flight price predictions.
